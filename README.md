# CODOPIA v0.1

As you know, we've developed codopia last year. This app was also built on the same year, but it was not hosted because we lack money to host it on a server. So, for you to learn about mobile dev and patch some bugs, we decided to make it open-source. The api and the apk are also attached.

## Features

- Code editor
- all functionalities of the app
- fancy animations
- and more...

## Steps for configuring

### Pre-requisities

- XAMPP - the api is built with PHP btw
- Nodejs - the mobile app is running on React-Native (react-native)

### Steps

0. Beg Gerum for the main website source code and sql schema
1. put the api on xampp htodcs folder (what is inside) validate if api folder exists
2. run xampp
3. run the ff commands in cmd in this directory vscode shortcut Ctrl+`
4. install the apk on your phone

```bash
npm install
npx expo --dev-client
```

and explore the app!

Note: Without what Gerum sends you, you can't use the app as a demo.

and btw, I modified the code for some of the modules but I dont remember what. So, tell me which part breaks and I will hopefully send you my files.
